### Findings
#### 1. What is the overall click-through rate (CTR) for the campaigns launched by the company?

The pie chart here shows the number of clicks and no clicks on each impression generated by the campaigns. According to this data, the average CTR for eCommerce search ads is 2.69%, for display ads the average is 0.51% and the CTR for email is 2.07%. The PopCart campaigns generated an overall CTR of 38.71%. If we were to compare this CTR with the industry benchmark, it shows that the campaigns launched by PopCart are effective.

#### 2. What is the CTR for each product category? 

The table and the chart here imply that the Electronics & Gadgets product category is the one that generates the most CTR despite having the least number of impressions. This trend strongly suggests that customers are most interested in Electronics & Gadgets. According      to the data from eworldtrade and Locad, Electronics & Gadgets are the top-selling product categories in the Philippines, and based on our chart and analysis, the data from the PopCart campaigns further aligns with this finding.

#### 3. What percentage of the total revenue generated during campaign periods is contributed by female customers?

Based on the Data presented in Figure 3, Female customers only contributed 2.77% of the total revenue. The contribution of Male customers is much higher, having 17.64% of the total revenue. This can be attributed to the fact that the category with the highest CTR as shown in Figure 2 is Electronic and Gadgets which dominantly appeals to male customers. 

To further support this finding from PopCart’s data, there is a study conducted by Standard Insights that suggests that males are more likely to buy consumer electronics online than females.

However, according to this data from Standard Insights and Spiralytics, 72%+ of Filipino online shoppers are female. They are also most likely to buy various online products. Taking this into account and its revenue potential, we should look into designing and launching female-centric digital marketing campaigns.
